# Laptop

Laptop is a guideline to help you setup an OS X laptop for development.

What it sets up
---------------

* [Git] for version control
* [Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) a beautiful terminal
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to run VMs
* [Docker](http://docker.com/) to run containers
* [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube/) to run Kubernetes
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to manage AWS
* [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install) to manage Google Cloud

[Git]: https://git-scm.com/

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Requirements
------------

We support:

* OS X Mavericks (10.9)
* OS X Yosemite (10.10)
* OS X El Capitan (10.11)

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoughtbot/laptop/master/mac
less mac
sh mac 2>&1 | tee ~/laptop.log
```

Debugging
---------

Your last Laptop run will be saved to `~/laptop.log`.
Read through it to see if you can debug the issue yourself.
If not, copy the lines where the script failed into a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/issues/new) for us.
Or, attach the whole log file as an attachment.

Customize in `~/.laptop.local`
------------------------------

Your `~/.laptop.local` is run at the end of the Laptop script.
Put your customizations there.
For example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

brew bundle --file=- <<EOF
brew "Caskroom/cask/dockertoolbox"
brew "go"
brew "ngrok"
brew "watch"
EOF

default_docker_machine() {
  docker-machine ls | grep -Fq "default"
}

if ! default_docker_machine; then
  docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
fi

default_docker_machine_running() {
  default_docker_machine | grep -Fq "Running"
}

if ! default_docker_machine_running; then
  docker-machine start default
fi

fancy_echo "Cleaning up old Homebrew formulae ..."
brew cleanup
brew cask cleanup

if [ -r "$HOME/.rcrc" ]; then
  fancy_echo "Updating dotfiles ..."
  rcup
fi
```

Write your customizations such that they can be run safely more than once.
See the `mac` script for examples.

Laptop functions such as `fancy_echo` and
`gem_install_or_update`
can be used in your `~/.laptop.local`.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop/wiki)
for more customization examples.
